# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the Self-Healing Data Pipeline project, including how to report vulnerabilities, our commitment to security, and guidelines for security researchers.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our data pipeline seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by our team.
2. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for the vulnerability.
3. **Email your findings to security@example.com**. If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key (available on our security page).
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including:
   - A clear description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any suggestions for mitigation or fixes
   - Your contact information for follow-up questions

We commit to the following response process:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- Provide an initial assessment of the report within 5 business days.
- Keep you informed about our progress as we work to address the issue.
- Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
- Recognize your contribution (if desired) when we disclose the issue.

## Security Update Process

When security vulnerabilities are identified, we follow this process:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
2. **Prioritization**: Assign a priority based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact.
3. **Development**: Create and test a fix for the vulnerability.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the fix to all affected environments.
5. **Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, publish information about the vulnerability.

Security updates are typically released as part of our regular release cycle, but critical vulnerabilities may receive expedited out-of-band patches.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

Only the latest major version of the Self-Healing Data Pipeline receives security updates. We recommend always using the latest version to ensure you have all security patches.

## Security Best Practices

When deploying and using the Self-Healing Data Pipeline, we recommend following these security best practices:

### Authentication and Access Control

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
- Regularly review and audit access permissions.
- Rotate service account keys and credentials regularly.

### Network Security

- Deploy the pipeline within a secure VPC network.
- Use VPC Service Controls to create security perimeters.
- Implement private connectivity for Google Cloud services.
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications.
- Configure appropriate firewall rules to restrict network access.

### Data Protection

- Enable encryption at rest for all data storage.
- Use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for sensitive data.
- Implement column-level security in BigQuery for sensitive fields.
- Apply data masking and tokenization where appropriate.
- Define and enforce data retention policies.

### Monitoring and Incident Response

- Enable comprehensive logging for all components.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities.
- Develop and test an incident response plan.
- Regularly review security logs and audit trails.
- Conduct periodic security assessments.

For more detailed security guidance, refer to our [Security Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/security.md) and [API Authentication Guide](docs/api/authentication.md).

For details on how to configure and use these security features, refer to our documentation.

## Security Compliance

The Self-Healing Data Pipeline is designed to help you meet various compliance requirements:

- **Data Protection Regulations**: Features to support GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations.
- **Industry Standards**: Controls aligned with standards like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST frameworks.
- **Google Cloud Compliance**: Leverages Google Cloud's compliance certifications and capabilities.

While the pipeline includes features to support compliance, proper configuration and implementation are necessary to meet specific compliance requirements in your environment.

## Security Vulnerability Disclosure

We are committed to transparency in our security practices. After addressing security vulnerabilities, we disclose them to our users through:

1. Security advisories in our GitHub repository
2. Release notes for security-related updates
3. Direct communication for critical vulnerabilities (when user contact information is available)

Disclosures typically include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Affected versions
- Steps to mitigate or update
- Credit to the security researcher (if applicable and desired)

We follow responsible disclosure practices and typically provide a 30-day notice before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities that have been fixed.

## Security Researcher Recognition

We value the contributions of security researchers who help improve our project's security. Researchers who report valid security vulnerabilities according to our responsible disclosure process will be:

- Acknowledged in our security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Considered for our bug bounty program (if applicable)

We do not pursue legal action against security researchers who act in good faith and follow our responsible disclosure guidelines.

## Contact Information

For security-related inquiries or to report vulnerabilities, please contact:

- **Email**: security@example.com
- **PGP Key**: Available on our security page

For general security questions, you can also open a discussion in the GitHub repository's Discussions section under the Security category.

## Changes to This Policy

This security policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes through our GitHub repository and documentation updates.

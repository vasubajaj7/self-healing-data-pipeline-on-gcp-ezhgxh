# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the self-healing data pipeline project. Our approach ensures high quality, reliability, and performance across all components of the system.

## Testing Principles

- **Shift Left**: Testing begins early in the development process
- **Automation First**: Automated testing is prioritized over manual testing
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All components and integration points are tested
- **Realistic Data**: Tests use realistic data scenarios that mirror production
- **Self-Healing Tests**: Test infrastructure includes resilience mechanisms

## Test Types

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

#### Framework
- Python components: pytest
- Web components: Jest with React Testing Library

#### Coverage Requirements
- Overall coverage target: 85%
- Critical paths: 90%+
- Self-healing components: 90%+
- Monitoring components: 85%+

#### Running Unit Tests
```bash
# Backend unit tests
src/test/scripts/run_unit_tests.sh

# Web unit tests
cd src/web && npm test
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

#### Key Integration Points
- Data ingestion to quality validation
- Quality validation to self-healing
- Self-healing to monitoring
- API endpoints to services

#### Environment
- Containerized services
- GCP test project
- Mock external systems

#### Running Integration Tests
```bash
src/test/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh
```

### End-to-End Testing

E2E tests verify complete workflows from start to finish.

#### Tools
- Cypress for web UI testing
- Playwright for complex scenarios
- Custom Python scripts for backend flows

#### Key Scenarios
- Complete data pipeline execution
- Self-healing of common issues
- Alert generation and notification
- Configuration changes

#### Running E2E Tests
```bash
src/test/scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests verify the system meets performance requirements under load.

#### Tools
- k6 for API load testing
- Locust for user scenario testing
- Custom benchmarking for BigQuery operations

#### Key Metrics
- Throughput: Data processing volume per time unit
- Latency: Response times for critical operations
- Resource utilization: CPU, memory, and storage usage
- Scalability: Performance under increasing load

#### Performance Thresholds
| Component | Metric | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Ingestion | Throughput | >100MB/s from GCS |
| Data Processing | Processing Time | <30 min for 10GB dataset |
| BigQuery Queries | Query Performance | <120% of baseline |
| Self-Healing | Response Time | <5 min for issue detection |

#### Running Performance Tests
```bash
src/test/scripts/run_performance_tests.sh
```

### Specialized Testing

#### Security Testing
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency scanning
- Secret detection
- Infrastructure security validation

#### Chaos Testing
- Component failure simulation
- Resource constraint testing
- Network partition testing
- Service degradation simulation

#### Data Quality Testing
- Schema validation
- Data content testing
- Transformation validation
- Golden dataset comparison

## Test Environments

### Local Development Environment
For developer testing during implementation:
```bash
# Start local test environment
src/test/environments/local/docker-compose.yml
```

### CI Test Environment
Automatically provisioned for CI pipeline:
```bash
# Setup test environment in GCP
src/test/environments/gcp/setup_test_env.py
```

### Staging Environment
Pre-production environment for final validation:
- Mirrors production configuration
- Uses anonymized production data
- Full integration with all services

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Sources
- Synthetic data generators
- Anonymized production data
- Golden datasets for validation
- Fault injection data

### Data Generation
```bash
# Generate test datasets
src/test/scripts/generate_test_data.sh
```

### Test Data Versioning
Test data is versioned alongside code to ensure reproducibility.

## CI/CD Integration

### Pull Request Validation
- Linting and static analysis
- Unit tests
- Integration tests for affected components
- Security scans

### Merge to Main
- Full test suite execution
- Performance regression testing
- Security validation

### Deployment Pipeline
- Smoke tests after deployment
- Canary testing
- Rollback automation on test failure

## Test Maintenance

### Flaky Test Management
- Detection of non-deterministic tests
- Quarantine process for unstable tests
- Required fixes for repeatedly flaky tests
- Stability metrics for test suite health

### Test Refactoring
- Regular test suite maintenance sprints
- Test performance optimization
- Removal of obsolete tests
- Consolidation of similar tests

### Test Reporting
- Centralized test results dashboard
- Trend analysis for test metrics
- Failure categorization
- Coverage reporting

## Testing Responsibilities

| Role | Testing Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Developers | Unit tests, integration tests, fixing test failures |
| QA Engineers | E2E test design, test automation framework, test results analysis |
| DevOps | Test infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, environment management |
| Data Engineers | Data quality test cases, performance test design |
| Security Team | Security test design, vulnerability assessment |

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Tests
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Avoid test interdependencies

### Test Organization
- Mirror production code structure in test directories
- Group tests by component and functionality
- Separate slow and fast tests
- Tag tests for selective execution

### Mocking and Stubbing
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Create reusable fixtures
- Prefer dependency injection for testability
- Document mock behavior clearly

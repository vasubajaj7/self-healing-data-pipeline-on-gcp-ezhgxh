# Troubleshooting Guide

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive troubleshooting guidance for developers working on the self-healing data pipeline. While the pipeline includes self-healing capabilities for many common issues, developers may still encounter problems during development, testing, or when extending the system. This guide covers common issues, diagnostic approaches, and resolution strategies for various components of the system.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this troubleshooting guide is to help developers:

- Diagnose and resolve common issues during development and testing
- Understand the diagnostic tools and approaches for different components
- Navigate the logs and monitoring data to identify root causes
- Apply effective resolution strategies for various problem types
- Determine when to escalate issues to the incident response process

This guide focuses on development-time troubleshooting rather than production incident response, which is covered in the [Incident Response](../operations/incident-response.md) documentation.

### How to Use This Guide

This guide is organized by system component, with each section covering common issues, diagnostic approaches, and resolution strategies specific to that component. To use this guide effectively:

1. Identify the component where the issue is occurring
2. Review the common issues for that component to find similar problems
3. Follow the diagnostic steps to gather more information
4. Apply the recommended resolution strategies
5. If the issue persists, check the escalation guidelines

For production incidents or issues that impact business operations, refer to the [Incident Response](../operations/incident-response.md) documentation.

### Relationship to Self-Healing

The self-healing data pipeline is designed to automatically detect and resolve many common issues without human intervention. This troubleshooting guide complements the self-healing capabilities by addressing:

- Issues that occur during development and testing
- Problems that fall outside the scope of automated healing
- Failures in the self-healing mechanisms themselves
- Complex issues requiring developer intervention
- Configuration and setup problems

Understanding the self-healing architecture (described in [Self-Healing Architecture](../architecture/self-healing.md)) will help you troubleshoot more effectively, as you'll better understand how the system attempts to resolve issues automatically.

## General Troubleshooting Approach

Before diving into component-specific troubleshooting, it's helpful to understand the general approach to diagnosing and resolving issues in the self-healing data pipeline.

### Diagnostic Methodology

Follow this general methodology when troubleshooting issues:

1. **Identify Symptoms**: Clearly define what's not working as expected
2. **Gather Information**: Collect logs, error messages, and context
3. **Isolate the Problem**: Determine which component is causing the issue
4. **Check Recent Changes**: Identify any recent changes that might have caused the issue
5. **Review Logs**: Examine relevant logs for error messages and patterns
6. **Check Monitoring**: Review monitoring dashboards for anomalies
7. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to reproduce the issue in a controlled environment
8. **Formulate Hypotheses**: Develop theories about potential causes
9. **Test Hypotheses**: Systematically test each potential cause
10. **Apply Resolution**: Implement the solution for the confirmed cause
11. **Verify Fix**: Ensure the issue is resolved and doesn't recur
12. **Document Findings**: Document the issue and resolution for future reference

This systematic approach helps ensure thorough investigation and effective resolution of issues.

### Key Diagnostic Tools

The following tools are essential for troubleshooting the self-healing data pipeline:

| Tool | Purpose | Access Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cloud Logging** | View logs from all GCP services | GCP Console > Logging |
| **Cloud Monitoring** | Monitor metrics and alerts | GCP Console > Monitoring |
| **Cloud Composer UI** | Manage and monitor Airflow DAGs | GCP Console > Composer > Airflow UI |
| **BigQuery Console** | Query data and view job history | GCP Console > BigQuery |
| **Cloud Storage Browser** | Examine stored files and data | GCP Console > Storage |
| **Vertex AI Console** | Monitor ML models and predictions | GCP Console > Vertex AI |
| **gcloud CLI** | Command-line interface for GCP | Terminal/Command Prompt |
| **bq CLI** | Command-line tool for BigQuery | Terminal/Command Prompt |
| **gsutil** | Command-line tool for Cloud Storage | Terminal/Command Prompt |
| **Python Debugger** | Debug Python code | IDE or command line |

Familiarity with these tools will significantly enhance your troubleshooting capabilities.

### Log Analysis Techniques

Effective log analysis is critical for troubleshooting. Use these techniques to get the most from your logs:

1. **Use Structured Queries**: In Cloud Logging, use structured queries to filter logs effectively:
   ```
   resource.type="cloud_composer_environment"
   severity>=ERROR
   resource.labels.environment_name="your-environment"
   ```

2. **Correlate with Trace IDs**: Use trace IDs to follow requests across services:
   ```
   trace="projects/your-project/traces/your-trace-id"
   ```

3. **Focus on Timeframes**: Narrow your search to relevant time periods:
   ```
   timestamp>="2023-06-15T10:00:00Z"
   timestamp<="2023-06-15T11:00:00Z"
   ```

4. **Look for Patterns**: Search for recurring error patterns:
   ```
   textPayload:"ConnectionError"
   ```

5. **Export for Analysis**: For complex analysis, export logs to BigQuery:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     timestamp,
     severity,
     textPayload
   FROM
     `your-project.your-dataset.your-log-table`
   WHERE
     severity = 'ERROR'
   ORDER BY
     timestamp DESC
   ```

6. **Create Log-Based Metrics**: For recurring issues, create log-based metrics to track frequency.

### When to Escalate

While many issues can be resolved through the procedures in this guide, some situations warrant escalation. Escalate issues when:

- The issue impacts production data or business operations
- The problem persists despite following all troubleshooting steps
- You suspect a security breach or data loss
- The issue affects multiple components or systems
- The problem is recurring with no clear pattern
- Resolution requires permissions or access you don't have

For escalation procedures, refer to the [Incident Response](../operations/incident-response.md) documentation.

## Environment and Setup Issues

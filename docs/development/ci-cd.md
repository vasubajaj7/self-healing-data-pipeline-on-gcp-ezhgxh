# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for the self-healing data pipeline project. The CI/CD pipeline automates the building, testing, validation, and deployment of the application to ensure consistent, reliable, and efficient delivery of changes to various environments.

## CI/CD Architecture

### Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions workflows that automate the entire software delivery process. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliability through automated testing and validation before deployment to target environments.

```

### Key Components

The CI/CD pipeline consists of several key components:

- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Automated workflows that execute CI/CD processes based on triggers such as code pushes, pull requests, and manual invocations.
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints that ensure code meets quality, security, and performance standards before proceeding to the next stage.
- **Artifact Registry**: Storage for built artifacts (Docker images) that are deployed to target environments.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool used to provision and manage Google Cloud resources.
- **Kubernetes/GKE**: Container orchestration platform for deploying and managing application containers.
- **Cloud Composer**: Managed Apache Airflow service for orchestrating data pipeline workflows.

### Workflow Triggers

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by various events:

| Event | Description | Target |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Pull Request | Triggers PR validation workflow to verify code quality and functionality before merging. | PR validation workflow |
| Push to develop branch | Triggers CI workflow and automatic deployment to development environment. | CI workflow → CD workflow (dev) |
| Push to main branch | Triggers CI workflow and deployment pipeline for production (with approval). | CI workflow → CD workflow (prod) |
| Manual workflow dispatch | Allows manual triggering of deployment to specific environments. | CD workflow (specified environment) |
| Scheduled execution | Weekly quality checks run automatically to ensure ongoing code quality. | Quality checks workflow |

## Continuous Integration

### CI Workflow

The Continuous Integration workflow (ci.yml) builds and tests the application components to ensure code quality and functionality.

| Staging to Production | - Successful UAT (User Acceptance Testing)<br>- Performance testing meets requirements<br>- Security review completed<br>- Change Advisory Board approval<br>- Rollback plan documented |

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback

The CI/CD pipeline includes automated rollback capabilities that are triggered when deployment validation fails.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Deploy[Deploy to Environment] --> Validate{Validation Tests}
    Validate -->|Pass| Success[Deployment Successful]
    Validate -->|Fail| Rollback[Automatic Rollback]
    Rollback --> Notify[Notify Team]
    Rollback --> PrevVersion[Restore Previous Version]
    PrevVersion --> ValidateRollback{Validate Rollback}
    ValidateRollback -->|Pass| RollbackSuccess[Rollback Successful]
    ValidateRollback -->|Fail| Escalate[Escalate to Team]
```

### Manual Rollback

In cases where a deployment issue is discovered after the validation phase, manual rollback procedures can be executed.

| Method | Command | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Kubernetes Rollback | `kubectl rollout undo deployment/DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n NAMESPACE [--to-revision=REVISION]` | Rolling back application deployments |
| Helm Rollback | `helm rollback RELEASE_NAME REVISION -n NAMESPACE` | Rolling back Helm-based deployments |
| Terraform Rollback | `terraform apply PREVIOUS_PLAN` | Rolling back infrastructure changes |
| Image Tag Rollback | Update deployment to use previous image tag | Quick rollback to previous container version |
| DAG Rollback | `gsutil cp PREVIOUS_VERSION gs://COMPOSER_BUCKET/dags/` | Rolling back Airflow DAG changes |

### Rollback Script

A dedicated rollback script is available for executing manual rollbacks:

**Script Path**: infrastructure/scripts/rollback.sh

**Usage**:
```bash
# Basic usage
./infrastructure/scripts/rollback.sh --project-id=PROJECT_ID --environment=ENVIRONMENT

# Full options
./infrastructure/scripts/rollback.sh \
  --project-id=PROJECT_ID \
  --environment=dev|staging|prod \
  --region=REGION \

# Backup and Restore Procedures

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance on backup and restore procedures for the self-healing data pipeline. It covers automated backup processes, recovery methods, and disaster recovery strategies for various components of the system.

Regular backups and tested recovery procedures are essential for ensuring business continuity and data integrity in the face of various failure scenarios, from accidental data deletion to complete regional outages. The self-healing data pipeline implements a multi-layered approach to backup and recovery, with appropriate mechanisms for different types of data and components.

### Backup and Recovery Principles

The backup and recovery strategy for the self-healing data pipeline is built on several key principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection including replication, backups, and snapshots
- **Automation First**: Automated backup processes to ensure consistency and reliability
- **Regular Testing**: Scheduled validation of backup integrity and recovery procedures
- **Tiered Approach**: Different backup strategies based on data criticality and recovery requirements
- **Secure by Design**: Encrypted backups with appropriate access controls
- **Compliance Alignment**: Retention policies that meet regulatory requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient use of storage and lifecycle management

These principles guide the implementation of backup and recovery throughout the pipeline, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to data protection.

### Backup and Recovery Objectives

The backup and recovery strategy defines specific objectives for different components and data types:

| Component | Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | Backup Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BigQuery Datasets | < 4 hours | < 24 hours | Daily |
| Cloud Storage Buckets | < 2 hours | < 24 hours | Daily |
| Configuration Files | < 1 hour | < 24 hours | Daily |
| GKE Cluster | < 4 hours | < 24 hours | Daily |
| Cloud Composer | < 4 hours | < 1 hour | Hourly metadata, Daily DAGs |

These objectives are defined based on business requirements and component criticality, with more stringent objectives for critical components and data. The backup and recovery procedures are designed to meet these objectives for different failure scenarios.

### Scope

This document covers backup and recovery procedures for the following components of the self-healing data pipeline:

- **Data Storage**
  - BigQuery datasets and tables
  - Cloud Storage buckets and objects
  - Metadata repositories

- **Configuration and Code**
  - Pipeline definitions and DAGs
  - Configuration files
  - Infrastructure as Code templates

- **Infrastructure Components**
  - GKE clusters and workloads
  - Cloud Composer environments
  - Custom services and applications

The procedures described in this document apply to all environments (development, staging, and production), with appropriate adjustments for each environment's specific requirements.

## Backup Architecture

The backup architecture of the self-healing data pipeline implements a comprehensive approach to data protection, with multiple mechanisms working together to ensure data resilience.

### Backup Components

The backup architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Automated Backup Scripts**: Scheduled scripts that execute backup operations for different components

2. **Backup Storage**: Dedicated Cloud Storage buckets for storing backup data with appropriate lifecycle policies

3. **Metadata Tracking**: Systems for tracking backup metadata, including timestamps, content, and validation results

4. **Validation Mechanisms**: Processes for validating backup integrity and completeness

5. **Retention Management**: Automated cleanup of old backups based on retention policies

These components work together to provide comprehensive backup capabilities for all critical data and configurations in the pipeline.

The backup flow illustrates how data from various sources is backed up through automated scripts, stored in dedicated backup storage, and managed through metadata tracking and lifecycle policies.

### Backup Storage Strategy

The backup storage strategy implements a tiered approach to balance accessibility, durability, and cost:

- **Primary Backup Storage**:
  - Dedicated Cloud Storage bucket in the primary region
  - Standard storage class for recent backups (0-30 days)
  - Versioning enabled for additional protection
  - CMEK encryption for sensitive data

- **Secondary Backup Storage**:
  - Cross-region replication to secondary region
  - Ensures backup availability even during regional outages
  - Same security controls as primary storage

- **Long-term Archive**:
  - Automatic transition to Nearline storage (30-90 days)
  - Automatic transition to Coldline storage (90+ days)
  - Lifecycle policies based on data criticality and compliance requirements

- **Backup Organization**:
  - Hierarchical folder structure by component type
  - Date-based organization for easy retrieval
  - Metadata files with backup details
  - Consistent naming conventions

This storage strategy ensures that backups are stored efficiently and securely, with appropriate accessibility based on age and criticality.

### Backup Security

Security measures for backup data protection:

- **Encryption**:
  - All backups encrypted at rest using Google-managed keys or CMEK
  - Encryption in transit for all backup operations
  - Key rotation according to security policies

- **Access Control**:
  - Dedicated service accounts for backup operations
  - Principle of least privilege for backup permissions
  - Separation of duties between backup and production access
  - Regular access review and audit

- **Immutability**:
  - Object versioning to prevent overwrites
  - Retention policies to prevent deletion
  - Audit logging of all backup operations

- **Secure Transfer**:
  - TLS encryption for all data transfers
  - Private Google access for GCP services
  - No public access to backup storage

These security measures ensure that backup data is protected against unauthorized access, modification, or deletion, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of backed-up data.

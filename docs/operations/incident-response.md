This document provides comprehensive guidance for responding to incidents in the self-healing data pipeline. While the pipeline includes automated self-healing capabilities that resolve many issues without human intervention, some incidents may require manual response and resolution. This guide outlines the procedures, roles, and tools for effective incident management.

Incident response for the self-healing data pipeline follows a structured approach designed to minimize impact, ensure rapid resolution, and capture learnings to prevent future occurrences. This document serves as the authoritative reference for all incident response activities.

## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope
This incident response guide serves several key purposes:

- Define a structured approach to incident management
- Clarify roles and responsibilities during incidents
- Establish communication protocols and channels
- Document escalation procedures and thresholds
- Outline post-incident analysis and improvement processes

This guide covers all incidents related to the self-healing data pipeline, including:

- Data quality incidents
- Pipeline execution failures
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
- Infrastructure failures
- Self-healing system issues

The procedures in this document apply to all environments (development, staging, and production), with appropriate adjustments for the criticality of each environment.

### Incident Response Philosophy
The incident response approach for the self-healing data pipeline is built on several key principles:

1. **Automation First**: Leverage the self-healing capabilities of the system whenever possible
2. **Rapid Response**: Minimize time to detection and resolution
3. **Clear Ownership**: Establish clear roles and responsibilities
4. **Blameless Culture**: Focus on process improvement, not individual blame
5. **Continuous Learning**: Use incidents as opportunities to improve the system
6. **Transparent Communication**: Maintain clear communication with all stakeholders

These principles guide all aspects of incident response, from initial detection through resolution and post-incident analysis.

### Relationship with Self-Healing
The self-healing data pipeline includes automated capabilities that can detect and resolve many issues without human intervention. The incident response procedures in this document complement these automated capabilities in several ways:

1. **Handling Exceptions**: Addressing incidents that the self-healing system cannot resolve automatically
2. **Providing Oversight**: Monitoring and verifying self-healing actions
3. **Managing Approvals**: Handling approval workflows for high-impact self-healing actions
4. **Addressing System Issues**: Responding to problems with the self-healing system itself
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Feeding insights from manual incident response back into the self-healing system

The goal is to continuously expand the self-healing capabilities of the system, reducing the need for manual incident response over time.

## Incident Classification
Incidents are classified based on severity, impact, and scope to ensure appropriate response and resource allocation. This classification determines notification channels, response times, and escalation procedures.

### Severity Levels
Incidents are categorized into four severity levels:

| Severity | Description | Examples | Response Time | Escalation Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P1 (Critical)** | Complete system failure or severe business impact affecting multiple critical pipelines or data | • Production pipeline complete failure<br>• Data corruption affecting business decisions<br>• Security breach | 15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **P2 (High)** | Significant impact to business operations with partial system functionality | • Critical pipeline component failure<br>• Significant performance degradation<br>• Data quality issues affecting reports | 1 hour | 2 hours |
| **P3 (Medium)** | Limited impact with most system functionality available | • Non-critical pipeline failures<br>• Minor performance issues<br>• Isolated data quality problems | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| **P4 (Low)** | Minimal impact with no effect on core functionality | • Cosmetic issues<br>• Non-critical warnings<br>• Minor optimization opportunities | 24 hours | N/A |

Severity may be upgraded or downgraded as more information becomes available during the incident response process.

### Impact Assessment
Impact assessment considers several dimensions to determine the overall severity of an incident:

1. **Business Impact**:
   - Critical business processes affected
   - Financial implications
   - Regulatory or compliance concerns
   - Reputational risk

2. **Technical Impact**:
   - Number of affected components
   - Data integrity concerns
   - Performance degradation
   - Security implications

3. **User Impact**:
   - Number of affected users
   - Types of affected users (executives, analysts, etc.)
   - Availability of workarounds
   - Duration of impact

4. **Recovery Complexity**:
   - Estimated time to resolve
   - Resource requirements
   - Dependency on external parties
   - Potential for data loss

The impact assessment should be continuously updated as new information becomes available during the incident response process.

### Incident Types
Incidents are categorized by type to guide the response approach and team assignment:

1. **Data Quality Incidents**:
   - Schema validation failures
   - Data integrity issues
   - Missing or corrupt data
   - Referential integrity violations

2. **Pipeline Execution Incidents**:
   - DAG or task failures
   - Scheduling issues
   - Dependency failures
   - Resource constraints

3. **Performance Incidents**:
   - Slow query execution
   - Processing delays
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Throughput degradation

4. **Infrastructure Incidents**:
   - Cloud service disruptions
   - Network issues
   - Storage problems
   - Compute resource failures

5. **Security Incidents**:
   - Unauthorized access attempts

   - Potential data exfiltration
   - Compliance violations

6. **Self-Healing System Incidents**:
   - Incorrect automated actions
   - Self-healing failures
   - Model performance issues
   - Configuration problems

Many incidents may span multiple categories, requiring a coordinated response across different specialized teams.

### Automated Classification
The monitoring system includes automated classification capabilities that assign initial severity and type based on alert context:

1. **Classification Factors**:
   - Alert source and category
   - Affected components and services
   - Historical patterns for similar alerts
   - Business context (time of day, business cycle)
   - Current system state

2. **Classification Workflow**:
   - Initial classification by monitoring system
   - Review and potential adjustment by on-call responder
   - Continuous reassessment throughout the incident
   - Final classification for post-incident analysis

3. **Classification Overrides**:
   - On-call responders can override automated classification
   - Escalation managers can adjust severity as needed
   - Business stakeholders may request severity adjustments

The automated classification system continuously improves through machine learning based on historical incident data and response patterns.

## Roles and Responsibilities
Clear definition of roles and responsibilities is essential for effective incident response. This section outlines the key roles involved in incident management and their specific responsibilities.

### Incident Response Team Structure
The incident response team follows a structured approach with clearly defined roles:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IM[Incident Manager] --> TC[Technical Coordinator]
    IM --> CC[Communications Coordinator]
    TC --> SME1[Subject Matter Experts]
    TC --> SME2[Technical Responders]
    CC --> Stakeholders[Stakeholders]
    CC --> Management[Management]
```

This structure scales based on incident severity, with smaller incidents potentially combining roles or eliminating some entirely. For P1 incidents, all roles are typically filled, while P3/P4 incidents may only involve technical responders.

### Key Roles and Responsibilities
| Role | Responsibilities | Staffed By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **On-Call Responder** | • Initial incident triage<br>• First-level response<br>• Escalation when needed<br>• Initial communication | Rotating on-call schedule |
| **Incident Manager** | • Overall incident coordination<br>• Resource allocation<br>• Escalation decisions<br>• Status tracking | Designated senior engineer or manager |
| **Technical Coordinator** | • Technical response leadership<br>• Solution development<br>• Technical resource coordination<br>• Technical documentation | Senior engineer with system expertise |

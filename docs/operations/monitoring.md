- **Health Checks**: Proactively verifies component health

These components work together to provide comprehensive visibility and automated response capabilities.

## Monitoring System Architecture

The monitoring system follows a layered architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and comprehensive coverage.

### Architecture Overview

The monitoring architecture consists of five main layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Collects metrics, logs, and events from all pipeline components

2. **Processing & Analysis Layer**: Processes collected data, detects anomalies, and identifies patterns

3. **Alert Management Layer**: Generates alerts, correlates related issues, and routes notifications

4. **Visualization Layer**: Presents monitoring data through dashboards and reports

5. **Integration Layer**: Connects with self-healing and other systems

This layered approach ensures separation of concerns while enabling comprehensive monitoring coverage. For a detailed technical overview of the architecture, refer to the [Monitoring Architecture](../architecture/monitoring.md) documentation.

### Component Interactions

The monitoring components interact through the following primary flows:

1. **Metrics Flow**:
   - Pipeline components emit metrics to Cloud Monitoring
   - Custom metrics are collected via the Monitoring API
   - Metrics are stored in Cloud Monitoring's time series database
   - Metrics are analyzed for anomalies and threshold violations
   - Metrics are visualized in dashboards and used for alerting

2. **Logging Flow**:
   - Components write structured logs to Cloud Logging
   - Logs are processed and filtered based on severity and content
   - Log-based metrics are extracted for monitoring
   - Logs are used for troubleshooting and audit purposes
   - Critical log entries can trigger alerts

3. **Alert Flow**:
   - Anomaly detection or threshold violations generate alert events
   - Alerts are processed by the alert correlation engine
   - Related alerts are grouped to reduce noise
   - Alerts are routed to appropriate notification channels
   - Alerts are stored for historical analysis
   - Critical alerts trigger self-healing processes

These flows ensure that monitoring data is collected, processed, and acted upon efficiently.

### Integration Points

The monitoring system integrates with several other systems:

# Data Ingestion User Guide: Self-Healing Data Pipeline

## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for configuring and managing data ingestion processes in the self-healing data pipeline. Data ingestion is the first step in the pipeline, responsible for extracting data from various sources and preparing it for further processing.

Whether you're working with Google Cloud Storage files, Cloud SQL databases, or external APIs, this guide will help you configure, monitor, and troubleshoot your data ingestion processes effectively.

### Purpose and Scope

This guide covers:

- Configuring different types of data sources
- Setting up extraction parameters and schedules
- Monitoring ingestion processes
- Troubleshooting common ingestion issues
- Best practices for reliable data ingestion

This guide is intended for data engineers and pipeline operators who are responsible for setting up and maintaining data ingestion processes. It assumes basic familiarity with the self-healing data pipeline system and its core concepts.

### Key Concepts

Before diving into the details, it's important to understand these key concepts:

- **Data Source**: A system that contains data to be extracted (e.g., GCS bucket, Cloud SQL database, API)
- **Connector**: A component that establishes connections to data sources and extracts data
- **Extraction Parameters**: Configuration settings that control how data is extracted
- **Ingestion Metadata**: Information about the extraction process, including timing, volume, and status
- **Staging Area**: Temporary storage for extracted data before further processing

The data ingestion process follows these general steps:
1. Connect to the data source
2. Extract data based on configured parameters
3. Capture metadata about the extraction
4. Stage the extracted data for quality validation
5. Hand off to the next pipeline stage

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced source configuration scenarios:

**Secure Credential Management:**
Instead of storing credentials directly in the configuration, use Secret Manager references:
```yaml
password: secret://customer-db-password
```

This references a secret named `customer-db-password` in Secret Manager, enhancing security by avoiding credential exposure in configuration files.

**Custom Connection Arguments:**
Many source types support custom connection arguments for specialized needs:
```yaml
connection_args:
  connect_timeout: 10
  application_name: self-healing-pipeline
  ssl_mode: require
```

**Custom Connectors:**
For specialized data sources, you can implement and register custom connectors:
```yaml
source_id: custom_source
source_type: CUSTOM
connection_config:
  connector_class: custom_connectors.specialized_connector.SpecializedConnector
  custom_config:
    param1: value1
    param2: 42
```

Custom connectors must implement the BaseConnector interface and be registered with the ConnectorFactory. See the [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/data-ingestion.md) for details on developing custom connectors.

## Pipeline Configuration

Once you've configured your data sources, you need to create pipelines that define how data is extracted, validated, and loaded.

### Creating a Data Ingestion Pipeline

To create a new data ingestion pipeline:

1. Navigate to **Pipeline Management** in the main menu
2. Click **[+ Create Pipeline]**
3. In the creation wizard, provide the following information:
   - **Basic Information**: Name, description, and owner
   - **Source Configuration**: Select the data source and configure extraction parameters
   - **Target Configuration**: BigQuery dataset, table, and schema information
   - **Quality Rules**: Data validation rules and thresholds
   - **Scheduling**: Execution schedule and dependencies
   - **Self-Healing Settings**: Configuration for automated healing capabilities

4. Review the configuration summary
5. Click **[Create Pipeline]** to finalize

The system will create the necessary Cloud Composer DAGs, BigQuery resources, and monitoring configurations based on your inputs.

### Extraction Parameters

Extraction parameters control how data is extracted from the source. The specific parameters depend on the source type:

**GCS Extraction Parameters:**
- **File Pattern**: Pattern to match files (e.g., `sales_*.csv`)
- **File Format**: Format of the files (CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet)
- **Read Options**: Format-specific options such as delimiters, headers, etc.
- **Batch Size**: Number of records to process in each batch
- **Parallel Extraction**: Whether to extract files in parallel

**Cloud SQL Extraction Parameters:**
- **Tables**: List of tables to extract
- **Incremental Extraction**: Whether to use incremental extraction
- **Incremental Field**: Field to use for incremental extraction (e.g., `updated_at`)
- **Batch Size**: Number of records to process in each batch
- **Parallel Extraction**: Whether to extract tables in parallel

**API Extraction Parameters:**
- **Endpoint**: The specific API endpoint to call
- **Method**: HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- **Parameters**: Request parameters
- **Data Path**: JSON path to the data in the response
- **Pagination**: Pagination settings
- **Batch Size**: Number of records to process in each batch

These parameters are configured in the **Source Configuration** step of the pipeline creation wizard.

### Transformation Settings

The pipeline can perform basic transformations during ingestion:

- **Column Mappings**: Map source columns to target columns
- **Type Conversions**: Convert data types (e.g., string to date)
- **Calculated Fields**: Create new fields based on expressions
- **Join Configuration**: Join multiple tables (for database sources)

These transformations are configured in the **Transformation** step of the pipeline creation wizard.

**Example Transformation Configuration:**
```yaml
transformation:
  enabled: true
  column_mappings:
    sale_id: sale_id
    sale_date: sale_date
    customer_id: customer_id
    product_id: product_id
    quantity: quantity
    unit_price: unit_price
  type_conversions:
    sale_date: DATE
    quantity: INTEGER
    unit_price: FLOAT
  calculated_fields:
    total_amount: quantity * unit_price
```

Complex transformations should be handled in subsequent pipeline stages rather than during ingestion.

### Loading Configuration

Loading configuration controls how data is loaded into BigQuery:

- **Write Disposition**: How to handle existing data (WRITE_APPEND, WRITE_TRUNCATE, WRITE_EMPTY)
- **Create Disposition**: Whether to create the table if it doesn't exist (CREATE_IF_NEEDED, CREATE_NEVER)
- **Partition Field**: Field to use for table partitioning
- **Partition Type**: Partitioning type (DAY, MONTH, YEAR, etc.)
- **Clustering Fields**: Fields to use for clustering

These settings are configured in the **Target Configuration** step of the pipeline creation wizard.

**Example Loading Configuration:**
```yaml
loading:
  write_disposition: WRITE_APPEND
  create_disposition: CREATE_IF_NEEDED
  partition_field: sale_date
  partition_type: DAY
  clustering_fields:
    - customer_id
    - product_id
```

Proper configuration of partitioning and clustering is essential for optimal BigQuery performance and cost efficiency.

### Scheduling and Dependencies

Pipeline scheduling controls when and how often the pipeline runs:

- **Schedule Interval**: When the pipeline should run (cron expression)
- **Start Date**: When the schedule should start
- **End Date**: When the schedule should end (optional)
- **Catchup**: Whether to run for missed intervals
- **Dependencies**: Other pipelines that must complete before this one runs

These settings are configured in the **Scheduling** step of the pipeline creation wizard.

**Example Scheduling Configuration:**
```yaml
schedule_interval: 0 */3 * * *  # Every 3 hours
start_date: 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z
catchup: false
dependencies:
  - other_pipeline_id
```

The schedule is implemented using Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow) DAGs, which provide powerful scheduling and dependency management capabilities.

### Example Pipeline Configuration

## Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced data ingestion topics for experienced users.

### Custom Connectors

For specialized data sources, you can develop custom connectors:

1. **Implement the BaseConnector Interface**:
   - Extend the `BaseConnector` class
   - Implement required methods: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `extract_data()`, `get_source_schema()`, `validate_connection_config()`
   - Add source-specific functionality

2. **Register the Connector**:
   - Register the connector with the `ConnectorFactory`
   - Configure the connector in the source configuration

3. **Deploy the Connector**:
   - Package the connector code
   - Deploy to the appropriate environment
   - Update the connector registry

Example custom connector implementation:
```python
from src.backend.ingestion.connectors.base_connector import BaseConnector, ConnectorFactory
from src.backend.constants import DataSourceType

class SpecializedConnector(BaseConnector):
    """Abstract base class that defines the interface for all data source connectors."""
    
    def __init__(self, source_id, source_name, connection_config):
        """Initialize the base connector with source information and connection configuration."""
        super().__init__(source_id, source_name, DataSourceType.CUSTOM, connection_config)
        # Custom initialization
        
    def connect(self):
        """Establish connection to the data source."""
        return True
        
    def disconnect(self):
        """Close connection to the data source."""
        return True
        
    def extract_data(self, extraction_params):
        """Extract data from the source based on extraction parameters."""
        return data, metadata
        
    def get_source_schema(self, object_name):
        """Retrieve the schema information for a source object."""
        return schema
        
    def validate_connection_config(self, config):
        """Validate the connection configuration."""
        return True

# Register the connector
ConnectorFactory().register_connector(DataSourceType.CUSTOM, SpecializedConnector)
```

See the [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/data-ingestion.md) for more details on developing custom connectors.

### Incremental Extraction Strategies

Incremental extraction is essential for efficiently processing large datasets. Several strategies are available:

**Timestamp-Based Extraction**
- Uses a timestamp field to identify new or changed records
- Requires a reliable timestamp that is updated on changes
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  incremental_extraction: true
  incremental_field: updated_at
  incremental_field_type: TIMESTAMP
  ```

**ID-Based Extraction**
- Uses an auto-incrementing ID to identify new records
- Suitable when only appends occur (no updates)
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  incremental_extraction: true
  incremental_field: id
  incremental_field_type: INTEGER
  ```

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**
- Uses database transaction logs to capture changes
- Provides comprehensive change tracking (inserts, updates, deletes)
- Requires database support for CDC
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  incremental_extraction: true
  extraction_method: CDC
  cdc_config:
    slot_name: pipeline_replication_slot
    publication_name: pipeline_publication
  ```

**Partition-Based Extraction**
- Processes data in partitions (e.g., by date)
- Suitable for data naturally partitioned by time
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  incremental_extraction: true
  extraction_method: PARTITION
  partition_field: date
  partition_format: YYYY-MM-DD
  ```

Choose the appropriate strategy based on your data characteristics and source system capabilities.

### Performance Optimization

To optimize ingestion performance:

**Parallel Processing**
- Configure parallel extraction for independent data sources
- Adjust the number of parallel workers based on source capabilities
- Monitor resource utilization during parallel extraction
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  parallel_extraction: true
  max_parallel_workers: 5
  ```

**Batch Size Optimization**
- Adjust batch size based on data characteristics
- Smaller batches for complex data, larger for simple data
- Monitor memory usage to find optimal batch size
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  batch_size: 5000
  ```

**Resource Allocation**
- Allocate appropriate resources to ingestion processes
- Consider dedicated resources for critical pipelines
- Monitor resource utilization and adjust as needed
- Configuration example (in Composer environment):
  ```yaml
  worker_resources:
    cpu: 2
    memory_gb: 8
  ```

**Query Optimization**
- Optimize database queries for extraction
- Use appropriate indexes
- Limit columns to those actually needed
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  query: SELECT id, name, created_at FROM customers WHERE updated_at > @last_extraction_time
  ```

Regularly review performance metrics and adjust configurations to maintain optimal performance as data volumes grow.

### API Integration Patterns

Advanced patterns for API integration:

**Pagination Handling**
- Configure appropriate pagination strategy for the API
- Set reasonable page size and limits
- Monitor rate limits during pagination
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  pagination_type: PAGE_NUMBER
  pagination_config:
    page_param: page
    size_param: size
    page_size: 100
    max_pages: 10
  ```

**Webhook Integration**
- Use webhooks for event-driven ingestion
- Configure webhook endpoints in the API
- Process webhook payloads as they arrive
- Implementation requires custom handling in Cloud Functions

**OAuth Authentication Flow**
- Configure OAuth authentication for APIs
- Manage token refresh and expiration
- Securely store refresh tokens
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  auth_type: OAUTH2
  auth_config:
    client_id: your-client-id
    client_secret: secret://oauth-client-secret
    token_url: https://api.example.com/oauth/token
    refresh_token: secret://oauth-refresh-token
    scopes: [read, data_access]
  ```

**Rate Limiting Compliance**
- Configure rate limits to comply with API restrictions
- Implement backoff strategies for rate limit errors
- Monitor rate limit usage
- Configuration example:
  ```yaml
  rate_limit_config:
    requests_per_minute: 60
    concurrent_requests: 5
    backoff_factor: 2.0
    max_backoff: 60

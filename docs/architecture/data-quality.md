    Rules --> Translator
    Translator --> Expectations
    Engine --> Runner
    Runner --> ValidationOps
    ValidationOps --> Converter
    Converter --> Results
    ValidationOps --> Reporter
```

#### Key Adapter Components

- **Rule Translator**: Converts data quality rules to Great Expectations expectations

|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Schema** | Column Existence | `expect_column_to_exist` |
| **Schema** | Data Type | `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type` |
| **Schema** | Nullability | `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null` |
| **Content** | Value Range | `expect_column_values_to_be_between` |
| **Content** | Value Set | `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set` |
| **Content** | Pattern Match | `expect_column_values_to_match_regex` |
| **Content** | String Length | `expect_column_value_lengths_to_be_between` |
| **Relationship** | Uniqueness | `expect_column_values_to_be_unique` |
| **Relationship** | Referential Integrity | `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set` (with dynamic set) |
| **Statistical** | Outlier Detection | `expect_column_quantile_values_to_be_between` |

FROM
  `project.dataset.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE
  table_name = 'target_table'
  AND column_name = 'expected_column';
```

**Non-Null Validation:**
```sql
-- Non-null check
WITH validation AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNTIF(column_name IS NULL) AS null_count
  FROM dataset.table
)
SELECT 
  IF(null_count = 0, 'PASS', 'FAIL') AS result,
  CAST(null_count AS STRING) AS errors,
  CAST(total_rows AS STRING) AS total,
  CAST(ROUND((null_count / total_rows) * 100, 2) AS STRING) AS error_percentage
FROM validation;
```

**Value Range Validation:**
```sql
-- Range check
WITH validation AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNTIF(numeric_column < min_value OR numeric_column > max_value) AS range_errors
  FROM dataset.table
  WHERE numeric_column IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  IF(range_errors = 0, 'PASS', 'FAIL') AS result,
  CAST(range_errors AS STRING) AS errors,
  CAST(total_rows AS STRING) AS total,
  CAST(ROUND((range_errors / total_rows) * 100, 2) AS STRING) AS error_percentage
FROM validation;
```

**Referential Integrity Validation:**
```sql
-- Referential integrity check
WITH validation AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNTIF(a.foreign_key NOT IN (SELECT primary_key FROM dataset.reference_table)) AS integrity_errors
  FROM dataset.main_table a
  WHERE a.foreign_key IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  IF(integrity_errors = 0, 'PASS', 'FAIL') AS result,
  CAST(integrity_errors AS STRING) AS errors,
  CAST(total_rows AS STRING) AS total,
  CAST(ROUND((integrity_errors / total_rows) * 100, 2) AS STRING) AS error_percentage
FROM validation;
```

**Statistical Validation:**
```sql
-- Outlier detection using z-score
WITH stats AS (
  SELECT 
    AVG(numeric_column) AS mean,
    STDDEV(numeric_column) AS std
  FROM dataset.table
  WHERE numeric_column IS NOT NULL
),
validation AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNTIF(ABS((numeric_column - mean) / std) > 3) AS outliers
  FROM dataset.table, stats
  WHERE numeric_column IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  IF(outliers < threshold, 'PASS', 'FAIL') AS result,
  CAST(outliers AS STRING) AS errors,
  CAST(total_rows AS STRING) AS total,
  CAST(ROUND((outliers / total_rows) * 100, 2) AS STRING) AS error_percentage
FROM validation;
```

- **Execution Time**: If validation is taking too long
- **Resource Utilization**: If resources are consistently near capacity
- **Failure Rates**: If validations are failing due to resource constraints
- **Queue Depth**: If validation requests are backing up
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balance between performance and cost

The framework's modular architecture enables flexible scaling approaches, allowing adaptation to different workload characteristics and growth patterns.

### Configuration Management

Proper configuration management is essential for reliable operation:

#### Configuration Categories

- **Framework Configuration**: Core settings for framework operation
- **Rule Configurations**: Settings for validation rules
- **Execution Configuration**: Settings for validation execution
- **Integration Configuration**: Settings for external integrations
- **Scaling Configuration**: Resource allocation settings
- **Security Configuration**: Access controls and security settings

#### Configuration Storage

- **Version-Controlled**: Configuration in source control
- **Environment-Specific**: Separate configs for dev/test/prod
- **Secret Management**: Sensitive settings in Secret Manager
- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic settings in Firestore
- **Deployment Configuration**: Infrastructure settings in Terraform

#### Configuration Validation

- **Schema Validation**: Verify configuration structure
- **Dependency Checking**: Validate configuration dependencies
- **Connectivity Testing**: Verify integration configurations
- **Permission Validation**: Check access control settings
- **Resource Validation**: Verify resource allocations

#### Configuration Deployment

- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated configuration deployment
- **Staged Rollout**: Progressive deployment across environments
- **Validation Gates**: Configuration validation before deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy reversion to previous configurations
- **Audit Trail**: Tracking of configuration changes

Proper configuration management ensures consistent, reliable operation across environments while enabling appropriate customization for different deployment scenarios.

# Self-Healing Data Pipeline: Disaster Recovery Architecture

## Introduction

The disaster recovery architecture of the self-healing data pipeline ensures business continuity and data resilience in the face of various failure scenarios. This document details the strategies, procedures, and infrastructure components that enable the pipeline to recover from disruptions ranging from individual component failures to complete regional outages.

Disaster recovery is a critical cross-cutting concern that affects all aspects of the pipeline, from data storage and processing to orchestration and monitoring. The architecture addresses recovery at multiple levels, providing appropriate mechanisms for different types of failures while balancing recovery capabilities with cost considerations.

### Disaster Recovery Principles

The disaster recovery architecture is built on several foundational principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of recovery capabilities to address different failure scenarios
- **Data Resilience**: Ensuring data availability and integrity through replication and backup
- **Service Continuity**: Maintaining critical pipeline services with minimal disruption
- **Automated Recovery**: Leveraging self-healing capabilities for automated recovery where possible
- **Tiered Recovery**: Different recovery approaches based on component criticality
- **Regular Testing**: Ongoing validation of recovery capabilities through testing
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from incidents to enhance recovery capabilities

These principles guide the implementation of disaster recovery throughout the pipeline, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to business continuity.

### Failure Scenarios

The disaster recovery architecture addresses several key failure scenarios:

- **Component Failure**: Individual service or component outage
- **Zone Failure**: Outage affecting a single zone within a region
- **Region Failure**: Complete regional outage affecting all services
- **Data Corruption**: Logical corruption of data requiring recovery from backups
- **Accidental Deletion**: Unintended deletion of data or resources
- **Service Disruption**: Temporary unavailability of dependent services
- **Network Partition**: Network connectivity issues between components

The architecture provides specific recovery strategies for each of these scenarios, with appropriate mechanisms, procedures, and recovery objectives.

### Recovery Objectives

The disaster recovery architecture defines specific recovery objectives for different components and scenarios:

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time to restore service after a failure
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time
- **Recovery Consistency Objective (RCO)**: The level of consistency required after recovery

These objectives are defined based on business requirements and component criticality, with more stringent objectives for critical components and data. The architecture implements appropriate recovery mechanisms to meet these objectives for different failure scenarios.

## Disaster Recovery Architecture Overview

The disaster recovery architecture follows a multi-layered approach, with different mechanisms for different types of failures and components.

```

The disaster recovery architecture consists of several key components working together to provide comprehensive recovery capabilities:

### Core Components

The disaster recovery architecture consists of several core components:

1. **Data Replication**: Mechanisms for replicating data across zones and regions to ensure availability in case of failures.

2. **Backup Systems**: Regular backups of data, configuration, and state to enable point-in-time recovery.

3. **Failover Mechanisms**: Automated and manual procedures for switching to backup components or regions.

4. **Recovery Coordination**: Systems for orchestrating the recovery process across multiple components.

5. **Monitoring and Detection**: Capabilities for detecting failures and triggering appropriate recovery actions.

These components work together to provide comprehensive recovery capabilities for different failure scenarios, with appropriate mechanisms for different types of components and data.

### Recovery Tiers

The disaster recovery architecture implements a tiered approach to recovery, with different mechanisms for different criticality levels:

- **Tier 1 (Mission Critical)**: Components and data that require the highest level of availability and minimal data loss. These use active-active configurations where possible, with synchronous or near-synchronous replication across regions.

- **Tier 2 (Business Critical)**: Components and data that are important for business operations but can tolerate slightly longer recovery times. These use active-standby configurations with asynchronous replication.

- **Tier 3 (Important)**: Components and data that support business operations but are not critical for core functions. These use backup-based recovery with regular backups and documented recovery procedures.

- **Tier 4 (Non-Critical)**: Components and data that are not critical for business operations. These use basic backup mechanisms with longer recovery times.

This tiered approach ensures that recovery resources are allocated appropriately based on business criticality, with more robust mechanisms for more critical components.

### Regional Strategy

The disaster recovery architecture implements a multi-region strategy for critical components:

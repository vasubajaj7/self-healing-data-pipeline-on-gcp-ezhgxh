"""
Implements the recovery orchestration component of the self-healing AI engine.
This module coordinates the end-to-end recovery process for pipeline failures and data quality issues
by integrating issue classification, root cause analysis, and appropriate correction strategies.
It serves as the central coordinator for self-healing actions, managing the workflow from issue
detection to resolution verification.

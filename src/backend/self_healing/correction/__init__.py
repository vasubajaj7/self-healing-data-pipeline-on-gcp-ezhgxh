"""
Initialization module for the self-healing correction package that exposes the core correction components. This module provides a unified interface to the various correction mechanisms including data correction, pipeline adjustment, resource optimization, and recovery orchestration. It serves as the entry point for the self-healing engine to access correction capabilities.

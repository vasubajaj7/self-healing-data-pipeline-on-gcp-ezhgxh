"""
Predicts performance metrics for BigQuery SQL queries using historical data and ML models.

This module provides functionality to:
- Extract features from SQL queries and query plans
- Retrieve historical performance data for similar queries
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for performance prediction
- Compare performance metrics between original and optimized queries
- Estimate query costs based on predicted resource usage

The module leverages BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA and query history to gather
training data and validate prediction accuracy.

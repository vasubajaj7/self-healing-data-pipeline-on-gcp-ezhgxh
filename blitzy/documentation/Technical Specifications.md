# 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

### System Overview

The self-healing data pipeline architecture follows a microservices-oriented design, leveraging fully managed Google Cloud services. This approach provides modularity, scalability, and resilience while minimizing operational overhead. The architecture employs event-driven patterns to enable asynchronous processing and loose coupling between components.

Key architectural principles include:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each component focuses on a specific responsibility (ingestion, validation, transformation, monitoring)
- **Infrastructure as code**: All environments maintained through declarative definitions for consistency and reproducibility
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of validation and self-healing to prevent data quality issues

### Data Flow Description

The pipeline begins with **data ingestion** from various sources, where raw data is extracted using source-specific connectors and temporarily staged in Cloud Storage. Metadata about the extraction (timestamps, record counts, source identifiers) is stored in Firestore for lineage tracking.

The **orchestration engine** coordinates the flow through defined DAGs in Cloud Composer, which trigger the extraction processes according to schedules or events. Pipeline state and execution metadata flow from Composer to the monitoring system for observability.

Extracted data moves to the **data quality framework**, where it undergoes validation against predefined expectations. Validation results flow to both the self-healing engine (for remediation of issues) and the monitoring system (for observability). Valid data proceeds to transformation; invalid data triggers the self-healing process.

The **self-healing engine** receives issue notifications, analyzes them using AI models, and applies appropriate corrections when confidence is high. Correction actions flow back to the appropriate pipeline stage, and learning data flows to model training pipelines to improve future healing capabilities.

Transformed data flows into **BigQuery** through optimized load processes that implement partitioning and clustering strategies. Query patterns and performance metrics flow to the optimization layer for continuous improvement.

Throughout the process, the **monitoring system** collects telemetry data, compares against baselines, and detects anomalies. Alert notifications flow to appropriate channels based on severity and type.

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Overall Pattern** | Microservices-oriented | Monolithic, Serverless | Provides modularity, independent scaling, and isolation while maintaining manageability within GCP ecosystem |
| **Processing Model** | Primarily batch with event triggers | Real-time streaming, Hybrid | Matches the nature of the source data systems and analytical workload requirements while managing resource efficiency |
| **Deployment Strategy** | Managed services with limited custom code | Containerized, Custom infrastructure | Minimizes operational overhead while leveraging Google's integration advantages and built-in scaling capabilities |
| **Data Management** | Stage-process-load with clear boundaries | ELT, Direct query federation | Creates clear validation checkpoints while enabling self-healing at multiple stages |

The microservices-oriented approach was selected to provide clear boundaries between pipeline components, enabling targeted self-healing and independent scaling. This approach facilitates incremental improvement of individual components without disrupting the entire pipeline.

Batch processing with event triggers provides the best balance of efficiency and responsiveness for analytical workloads. While real-time streaming was considered, it would introduce unnecessary complexity for use cases not requiring sub-minute latency.

### Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Application | Benefits | Tradeoffs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Orchestrated API Calls** | Component coordination | Clear execution sequence, transactional boundaries | Tighter coupling, potential cascading failures |
| **Message-Based Events** | Status notifications, asynchronous processing | Loose coupling, buffer for load spikes | Additional infrastructure, eventual consistency |
| **Shared State Repository** | Pipeline status tracking, metadata management | Centralized visibility, simplified recovery | Potential bottleneck, consistency challenges |
| **Webhook Callbacks** | External system notifications | Simple integration, standardized patterns | Delivery guarantees, security considerations |

Communication patterns were selected to balance the need for orchestration control with system resilience. Airflow provides the primary orchestration backbone with direct API calls, while event-based patterns are used for notification and monitoring to reduce coupling.

### Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Category | Selected Solution | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Raw Source Data** | Cloud Storage | Cost-effective, immutable storage providing a reliable "source of truth" and enabling reprocessing when needed |
| **Processed Analytics Data** | BigQuery | Serverless analytics database with separation of storage and compute, ideal for high-volume analytical workloads |
| **Pipeline Metadata** | Firestore | Flexible document structure for varying metadata types, good performance for read-heavy workloads |
| **State Management** | Cloud Composer (Airflow DB) | Integrated with orchestration engine, optimized for task state tracking |

The storage architecture follows a multi-tier approach, using the most appropriate storage technology for each data category. Cloud Storage provides an immutable landing zone for raw data, enabling historical reprocessing when needed. BigQuery serves as the primary analytical store, with its decoupled storage and compute model supporting cost-effective scaling.

### Architecture Decision Record: AI-Driven Self-Healing

**Context**: Traditional pipeline error handling relies on predefined rules and manual intervention, leading to operational overhead and prolonged resolution times.

**Decision**: Implement an AI-driven self-healing system using Vertex AI with the following components:
1. Anomaly detection models to identify potential issues
2. Classification models to categorize detected issues
3. Resolution recommendation models to suggest fixes
4. Autonomous action models for high-confidence fixes

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Reduced mean time to resolution, decreased operational burden, improved pipeline reliability
- Negative: Initial development complexity, model training requirements, need for ongoing feedback loops
- Risks: False positives/negatives, inappropriate automatic fixes, model drift over time

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Start with rule-based detection and human-in-the-loop fixes
2. Gradually introduce prediction models for specific error categories
3. Implement confidence scoring to determine autonomous action boundaries
4. Establish feedback mechanisms to continuously improve models

## CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

### Monitoring and Observability Approach

The monitoring and observability strategy focuses on comprehensive visibility across all pipeline components while preventing alert fatigue through intelligent correlation and prioritization.

**Key Metrics by Component**:

| Component | Key Metrics | Thresholds | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Ingestion** | Source availability, extraction duration, record count variance | >10% time variance, >20% volume variance | Trigger validation, adjust scheduling |
| **Data Quality** | Validation pass rate, quality score, error category distribution | <98% pass rate, <90% quality score | Invoke self-healing, notify data stewards |
| **Self-Healing** | Resolution success rate, correction confidence, response time | <80% success, >5 min response | Review model performance, expand training data |
| **BigQuery** | Query performance, slot utilization, storage growth | >20% performance degradation | Apply query optimization, adjust resources |

The monitoring system implements a three-tier approach:
1. **Infrastructure monitoring**: Resource utilization, service health, and quota consumption
2. **Application monitoring**: Pipeline execution, component performance, and error rates
3. **Business monitoring**: Data quality, freshness, and business rule compliance

Custom dashboards provide role-specific views with appropriate levels of detail for operators, data engineers, and business stakeholders.

### Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Category | Content | Retention | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Operational Logs** | Pipeline execution events, component communication, system actions | 30 days | Pipeline operators, data engineers |
| **Error Logs** | Detailed error information, stack traces, contextual data | 90 days | Development team, support engineers |
| **Audit Logs** | Security events, configuration changes, data access | 1 year | Security team, compliance officers |
| **Data Transformation Logs** | Schema changes, transformation details, data lineage | 90 days | Data engineers, data analysts |

Log entries follow a structured format with consistent fields including:
- Timestamp with millisecond precision
- Correlation ID for end-to-end tracing
- Component identifier and version
- Event severity and category
- Context-specific details in structured JSON

Distributed tracing using Cloud Trace provides visibility into request flows across components, with sampling rates adjusted based on transaction criticality.

### Error Handling Patterns

    ERROR[Error Occurs] --> CLASSIFY{Classify Error}
    
    CLASSIFY -->|Transient| RETRY[Apply Retry Pattern]
    CLASSIFY -->|Validation| VALIDATE[Apply Validation Response]

    RETRY --> MAX_ATTEMPTS[Maximum Attempt Limit]
    RETRY --> CIRCUIT_BREAKER[Circuit Breaker Pattern]
    
    VALIDATE --> DATA_QUARANTINE[Data Quarantine]
    VALIDATE --> PARTIAL_PROCESSING[Partial Processing]
    VALIDATE --> DEFAULT_VALUES[Default Value Substitution]
    
    RESOURCE --> GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION[Graceful Degradation]
    RESOURCE --> RESOURCE_SCALING[Dynamic Resource Scaling]
    RESOURCE --> WORKLOAD_SHIFT[Workload Shifting]
    
    SECURITY --> ACCESS_REVOCATION[Access Revocation]
    SECURITY --> CREDENTIAL_ROTATION[Credential Rotation]
    SECURITY --> ISOLATION[Component Isolation]
    
    BACKOFF --> LOG[Log Error Context]
    MAX_ATTEMPTS --> LOG
    CIRCUIT_BREAKER --> LOG
    DATA_QUARANTINE --> LOG
    PARTIAL_PROCESSING --> LOG
    DEFAULT_VALUES --> LOG
    GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION --> LOG
    RESOURCE_SCALING --> LOG
    WORKLOAD_SHIFT --> LOG
    ACCESS_REVOCATION --> LOG
    CREDENTIAL_ROTATION --> LOG
    ISOLATION --> LOG
    
    LOG --> NOTIFY[Notify Appropriate Channel]
    NOTIFY --> LEARN[Feed to Learning System]
```

The system implements a comprehensive error handling approach with specific patterns for different error categories. All error responses include detailed context capture, appropriate notification, and feedback into the learning system for continuous improvement of self-healing capabilities.

Error boundaries are established at key points in the pipeline to prevent cascading failures, with each component designed to fail safely without compromising data integrity or downstream processing.

### Authentication and Authorization Framework

| Access Category | Authentication Method | Authorization Approach | Principle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Service-to-Service** | Service account keys, Workload Identity | IAM roles with least privilege | Zero trust, service boundaries |
| **Human Operations** | Google Cloud Identity, MFA | IAM roles with time-limited elevation | Just-in-time access, audit logging |
| **External Systems** | API keys, OAuth 2.0 tokens | Scoped access with expiration | Rate limiting, usage monitoring |
| **Data Access** | Service accounts, user identities | Column-level security, row-level access | Data classification, need-to-know |

Authentication and authorization follow a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of control. Service accounts use fine-grained IAM roles limited to specific resources and actions. Human access leverages Cloud Identity with MFA and conditional access policies.

Data access is governed through BigQuery's column-level and row-level security features, with policies defined based on data classification and compliance requirements.

### Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Pipeline Category | Completion SLA | Recovery SLA | Availability Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical Business Data** | 4 hours from source availability | 30 minutes from failure | 99.9% successful execution |
| **Standard Analytics Data** | 8 hours from source availability | 2 hours from failure | 99.5% successful execution |
| **Auxiliary Data Sets** | 24 hours from source availability | Next business day | 99.0% successful execution |

Performance requirements extend beyond completion times to include resource efficiency metrics:
- BigQuery slot utilization optimization
- Storage cost management through lifecycle policies
- Network transfer minimization through co-location

Regular performance testing validates these requirements with synthetic and production-derived datasets, with results feeding into continuous optimization efforts.

### Disaster Recovery Procedures

| Scenario | Recovery Approach | RTO | RPO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Component Failure** | Automated restart with self-healing | 30 minutes | 0 minutes (no data loss) |
| **Zone Outage** | Cross-zone resilience in same region | 1 hour | 0 minutes (no data loss) |
| **Region Failure** | Manual failover to secondary region | 4 hours | 24 hours (daily backups) |
| **Data Corruption** | Point-in-time recovery from backups | 2 hours | Dependent on detection time |

The disaster recovery strategy employs a tiered approach with increasing recovery times based on failure scope. For component and zone failures, automated recovery mechanisms provide near-zero downtime. For region-level failures, a documented manual failover process ensures business continuity.

Data corruption scenarios rely on immutable data in Cloud Storage and point-in-time recovery capabilities in BigQuery, with validation procedures to verify recovered data integrity.

Regular disaster recovery tests validate these procedures, with results incorporated into continuous improvement of the recovery process.

#### Indexing Strategy

In BigQuery, traditional database indexes are replaced by partitioning and clustering:

| Table | Partitioning Strategy | Clustering Keys | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pipeline_executions | Time-partitioned by start_time (daily) | pipeline_id, status | Optimizes queries by date range and pipeline |
| task_executions | Time-partitioned by start_time (daily) | execution_id, task_id | Enables efficient querying of tasks |
| quality_validations | Time-partitioned by validation_time (daily) | execution_id, passed | Improves performance for validation results |
| healing_executions | Time-partitioned by execution_time (daily) | pattern_id, successful | Enables analysis of healing effectiveness |
| pipeline_metrics | Time-partitioned by collection_time (hourly) | metric_category, pipeline_id | Supports time-series analysis |
| alerts | Time-partitioned by created_at (daily) | severity, acknowledged | Optimizes queries for alert management |

For smaller reference tables (source_systems, pipeline_definitions, quality_rules), we don't use partitioning as these tables have limited row counts.

#### Partitioning Approach

Our BigQuery partitioning strategy optimizes both query performance and cost:

1. **Time-Based Partitioning**:
   - Operational tables use daily partitioning on timestamp columns
   - Metrics tables use hourly partitioning for higher granularity
   - Partition pruning reduces data scanned during queries

2. **Partition Expiration**:
   - Automatic partition expiration for operational data:
     - pipeline_executions: 90 days
     - task_executions: 30 days
     - quality_validations: 90 days
     - pipeline_metrics: 30 days

3. **Partition Management**:
   - Quarterly assessment of partition usage patterns
   - Adjustment of partitioning strategy based on query patterns
   - Monitoring of partition sizes for optimization

#### Replication Configuration

The following replication strategy ensures data availability and disaster recovery:

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

#### Identity Management

| Identity Type | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Service Accounts** | GCP IAM Service Accounts | Machine-to-machine authentication for pipeline components |
| **User Identities** | Cloud Identity integration with enterprise SSO | Human access to administration and data interfaces |
| **Workload Identity** | GKE Workload Identity | Secure Kubernetes workload authentication |
| **External System Auth** | Secret Manager + API keys | Authenticated access for external data sources |

The self-healing pipeline implements a layered identity management approach, leveraging Google Cloud's native identity services while supporting enterprise integration requirements.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Data Engineer
    participant App as Pipeline Interface
    participant IAM as Cloud IAM
    participant IdP as Enterprise IdP
    participant Service as Pipeline Service
    
    User->>App: Access Request
    App->>IAM: Authentication Request
    IAM->>IdP: Federated Authentication
    IdP->>User: MFA Challenge
    User->>IdP: MFA Response
    IdP->>IAM: Identity Verification
    IAM->>App: Issue OAuth Token
    App->>Service: Request with Token
    Service->>IAM: Validate Token
    IAM->>Service: Token Valid + User Context
    Service->>User: Access Granted
```

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

| Access Type | MFA Requirement | Verification Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Console Access** | Required for all users | FIDO security keys, mobile authenticator app |
| **API Access** | Required for privileged operations | OAuth 2.0 with MFA-verified credential generation |
| **Emergency Access** | Break-glass procedure with approval | Time-limited tokens with extended logging |
| **Service Accounts** | Not applicable | Secured through key rotation and restriction |

Multi-factor authentication is enforced for all human users accessing system components, with specific verification requirements based on the sensitivity of operations being performed.

#### Session Management

| Session Type | Timeout Setting | Renewal Process |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Console Sessions** | 8 hours maximum, 30 minutes idle | Re-authentication required |
| **API Sessions** | 1 hour token validity | OAuth refresh flow with validation |
| **Service Sessions** | Varies by service (8-24 hours) | Automated token refresh with service account |
| **Elevated Sessions** | 1 hour maximum | No automatic renewal, requires re-approval |

Session parameters are configured to balance security with operational usability, enforcing regular re-authentication while minimizing disruption to legitimate workflows.

#### Token Handling

| Token Type | Implementation | Security Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OAuth 2.0 Access** | JWT with standard claims | Short expiration, audience validation |
| **API Keys** | Scoped API keys in Secret Manager | Regular rotation, usage monitoring |
| **Service Account Keys** | JSON key files (where necessary) | 90-day rotation, access restrictions |
| **Internal Service** | Self-signed tokens or Workload Identity | Scoped to specific services, short-lived |

Token-based authentication is implemented consistently across the system, with appropriate security controls for each token type and use case.

### 6.4.2 AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Role-Based Access Control

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Access Request Flow"
        Request[Access Request] --> Auth[Authentication]
        Auth --> Identity[Identity Established]
        Identity --> Roles[Retrieve Roles]

        Decision -->|Allow| Grant[Grant Access]
        Decision -->|Deny| Reject[Reject Access]
        Grant --> Audit[Audit Log: Success]
        Reject --> Audit2[Audit Log: Failure]
    end
```

| Role | Permissions | Assignment Scope | Approval Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pipeline Administrator** | Full control of pipeline infrastructure | Limited to infrastructure team | Senior management |
| **Data Engineer** | Create/modify pipeline definitions | Project-specific assignment | Team lead |
| **Data Analyst** | Query data, view metadata | Dataset-level access | Department head |
| **Pipeline Operator** | Monitor and troubleshoot pipelines | Environment-based scoping | Operations manager |

The authorization system follows a least-privilege model with custom IAM roles defined for each function within the system. Role definitions are regularly reviewed for permission creep and adjusted to maintain security boundaries.

#### Permission Management

| Permission Category | Implementation Approach | Review Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Resource Access** | IAM Conditions with resource hierarchies | Quarterly |
| **Data Access** | Column-level security in BigQuery | Monthly |
| **Control Plane** | Administrative role restrictions | Quarterly |
| **External Integration** | Service account permission boundaries | Monthly |

Permissions are implemented at the most granular level practical, with conditional access policies that consider context such as access location, time, and request properties.

#### Resource Authorization

| Resource Type | Authorization Controls | Additional Protection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BigQuery Datasets** | Dataset-level IAM + column security | Table access controls, row-level security |
| **Cloud Storage** | Bucket and object IAM | Object versioning, lifecycle policies |
| **Cloud Composer** | Environment-level access | Network controls, private IP |
| **AI Models** | Model registry permissions | Versioned access, endpoint protection |

Resource authorization combines IAM permissions with resource-specific controls to create defense-in-depth protection for all system components.

#### Policy Enforcement Points

| Enforcement Point | Implementation | Protection Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Gateway** | Authentication and rate limiting | External API access |
| **IAM Policies** | Resource-level policy bindings | All GCP resources |
| **VPC Service Controls** | Service perimeter definitions | Data exfiltration prevention |
| **Application-Level** | Custom authorization in code | Fine-grained access control |

Multiple policy enforcement points ensure consistent security controls across all system interfaces, with layered protection that prevents single points of failure.

#### Audit Logging

| Log Category | Retention Period | Analysis Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Admin Activity** | 400 days (regulatory minimum) | Cloud Logging, Security Command Center |
| **Data Access** | 30 days standard, 7 years for sensitive | BigQuery log analysis, custom dashboards |
| **System Events** | 30 days | Cloud Monitoring alerts, log-based metrics |
| **Security Findings** | 1 year | Security Command Center, SIEM integration |

Comprehensive audit logging is implemented across all system components, with appropriate retention periods based on data sensitivity and compliance requirements.

### 6.4.3 DATA PROTECTION

#### Encryption Standards

| Data State | Encryption Method | Key Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data at Rest** | Google default + CMEK where required | Cloud KMS with automated rotation |
| **Data in Transit** | TLS 1.2+ with modern cipher suites | Google-managed certificates + custom certs |
| **Sensitive Fields** | Application-level encryption | Separate key hierarchy with access controls |

## 8.3 CONTAINERIZATION

### 8.3.1 Container Platform Selection

Container technology is used selectively for custom components that require specialized environments or need to be deployed across multiple services:

| Component Type | Containerization Approach | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Data Processors | Containerized with GKE | Complex dependencies and scaling requirements |
| ML Model Serving | Containerized with Vertex AI | Custom model requirements and reproducibility |
| Data Quality Components | Containerized with Cloud Run | Stateless validation with variable load |
| Standard Pipeline Components | Managed services (non-containerized) | Leverage fully managed GCP services |

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is selected as the primary container platform for these reasons:

1. **Native GCP integration** with IAM, logging, and monitoring
2. **Autopilot mode** for reduced operational overhead
3. **Scalability** for handling variable workloads
4. **Workload Identity** for secure service authentication

### 8.3.2 Base Image Strategy

| Image Type | Base Image | Customization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python Applications | python:3.9-slim | • Required libraries<br>• Monitoring agents<br>• Security hardening |
| Data Processing | apache/beam:2.46.0 | • Custom connectors<br>• Processing libraries<br>• Monitoring instrumentation |
| ML Model Serving | tensorflow/serving:2.12.0 | • Custom model artifacts<br>• Inference optimizations<br>• Monitoring endpoints |

**Base Image Security Hardening:**
1. Minimal distro with reduced attack surface
2. Regular security updates
3. Non-root user execution
4. Removed unnecessary tools and packages

### 8.3.3 Image Versioning Approach

| Versioning Component | Strategy | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic Versioning | Major.Minor.Patch format | v1.2.3 |
| Build Identifiers | CI build numbers appended | v1.2.3-b78 |
| Environment Tags | Environment-specific tags | v1.2.3-prod |
| Latest Tag | Points to latest stable release | latest |

Image versioning is tightly integrated with the CI/CD pipeline:
1. **Development builds**: Tagged with branch and commit hash
2. **Release candidates**: Tagged with RC designation
3. **Production releases**: Tagged with semantic version
4. **Immutable images**: Never overwrite existing tags

### 8.3.4 Build Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-stage Builds | Separate build and runtime stages | Smaller final images, reduced attack surface |
| Layer Caching | Optimized Dockerfile ordering | Faster builds, reduced resource usage |
| Dependency Management | Requirements pinning and auditing | Reproducible builds, security scanning |
| Parallel Building | Cloud Build with parallel steps | Reduced build times |

### 8.3.5 Security Scanning Requirements

| Scan Type | Tool | Frequency | Action on Findings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Container Analysis API | Every build | Block deployment for critical/high |
| Secret Detection | Secret Scanner | Every build | Block on any detected secrets |
| License Compliance | License Scanner | Every build | Block on prohibited licenses |
| Configuration Analysis | Trivy | Every build | Block on critical misconfigurations |

## 8.4 ORCHESTRATION

### 8.4.1 Orchestration Platform Selection

The solution uses a dual orchestration approach:

GKE clusters are configured for optimal performance and reliability:

| Cluster Configuration | Specification | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control Plane | Regional deployment | High availability of control plane |
| Node Architecture | Regional with multi-zone nodes | Resilience against zone failures |
| Cluster Type | GKE Standard | Fine-grained control over configuration |
| Node Auto-Provisioning | Enabled with constraints | Dynamic resource allocation |
| Maintenance Window | Configured for minimal impact | Reduce disruption during updates |

### 8.4.3 Service Deployment Strategy

| Service Type | Deployment Approach | Update Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stateless Services | Deployments with multiple replicas | Rolling updates with readiness probes |
| Stateful Services | StatefulSets with persistent storage | Careful orchestration with backup/restore |
| Batch Processors | Jobs and CronJobs | Version-specific images |
| Configuration | ConfigMaps and Secrets | Versioned and environment-specific |

**Deployment Best Practices:**

1. **Health checks** for all services (liveness and readiness)
2. **Resource quotas** to prevent resource starvation
3. **Pod disruption budgets** for availability during updates
4. **Network policies** for service isolation
5. **Service accounts** with least privilege

### 8.4.4 Auto-scaling Configuration

| Scaling Type | Implementation | Metrics | Thresholds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Horizontal Pod Autoscaling | HPA with custom metrics | • CPU utilization<br>• Memory usage<br>• Custom metrics | • Scale out: >70% utilization<br>• Scale in: <50% utilization |
| Vertical Pod Autoscaling | VPA in recommendation mode | • Resource usage patterns<br>• Request/limit ratio | • Recommendations reviewed manually |
| Cluster Autoscaler | Node auto-provisioning | • Pending pods<br>• Node utilization | • Scale out: pending pods<br>• Scale in: <40% utilized for 10+ min |

**Scaling Policies:**

1. **Minimum replicas** to ensure availability
2. **Maximum replicas** to control costs
3. **Scale-down delays** to prevent thrashing
4. **Target utilization** balancing responsiveness and efficiency
5. **Custom metrics** for workload-specific scaling

### 8.4.5 Resource Allocation Policies

| Resource Type | Allocation Strategy | Monitoring |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | • Requests based on baseline<br>• Limits based on peak | • Utilization metrics<br>• Throttling events |
| Memory | • Requests based on minimum working set<br>• Limits to prevent node pressure | • Usage metrics<br>• OOM events |
| Disk | • Persistent volumes for stateful services<br>• SSD for IO-intensive workloads | • Utilization metrics<br>• IOPS and throughput |
| GPU | • Dedicated nodes for ML workloads<br>• Time-sharing for training jobs | • Utilization metrics<br>• Training job completion |

**Quality of Service Classes:**

1. **Guaranteed**: Critical services with equal requests and limits
2. **Burstable**: Standard services with defined requests, higher limits
3. **BestEffort**: Batch processing and non-critical services

## GLOSSARY

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Anomaly Detection** | The identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. In the context of data pipelines, refers to identifying unusual patterns in data or pipeline execution metrics. |
| **Backfill** | The process of processing historical data that was missed during a pipeline failure or newly added to a data source. |
| **Batch Processing** | A method of processing high volumes of data at scheduled intervals rather than in real-time. |
| **Circuit Breaker Pattern** | A design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties. |
| **Clustering** | In BigQuery, a table organization method that sorts data based on the contents of specified columns to improve query performance and reduce costs. |
| **Data Catalog** | A centralized metadata repository that helps organizations discover, understand, and manage their data assets. |
| **Data Drift** | The phenomenon where the properties of the data change over time, potentially affecting the performance of machine learning models or data quality validations. |
| **Data Lineage** | The documentation of data's origins, movements, transformations, and characteristics throughout its lifecycle. |
| **Data Validation** | The process of ensuring data is clean, correct, and useful by running it through a set of predefined rules. |
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | A graph structure used in Apache Airflow to define workflow tasks and their dependencies, ensuring tasks execute in the correct order. |
| **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** | A three-phase process where data is extracted from sources, transformed to meet operational needs, and loaded into a target database. |
| **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** | A variation of ETL where data is loaded into the target system before transformation, leveraging the target system's processing capabilities. |
| **Idempotence** | The property of certain operations whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. |
| **Imputation** | The process of replacing missing data with substituted values based on statistical methods or machine learning models. |
| **Orchestration** | The automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems, applications, and services. |
| **Partitioning** | In BigQuery, a method of dividing tables into segments to improve query performance and control costs. |
| **Pipeline Drift** | Changes in pipeline performance metrics over time that may indicate developing issues or inefficiencies. |
| **Quality Gate** | A checkpoint in the data pipeline that ensures data meets defined quality criteria before proceeding to the next stage. |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | A method of problem-solving used to identify the origin of faults or problems. |
| **Self-Healing** | The ability of a system to detect and recover from potential problems automatically without human intervention. |
| **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** | A commitment between a service provider and a client about aspects of the service such as quality, availability, and responsibilities. |
| **Service Level Objective (SLO)** | A key element of an SLA that defines a target level of service for a specific metric. |
| **Slot** | The unit of computational capacity in BigQuery used to execute SQL queries. |
| **Stateful Processing** | Data processing that maintains information about its state between executions. |
| **Stateless Processing** | Data processing that doesn't maintain state information between executions. |
| **Time Series Analysis** | Statistical methods for analyzing time-ordered data points to extract meaningful characteristics. |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | The coordination and management of complex data pipelines across multiple systems and services. |

```
Design an **end-to-end self-healing data pipeline** for BigQuery using **Google Cloud services** and AI-driven automation. The pipeline should:  

### **Data Ingestion:**  
- Read data from multiple sources, including:  
  - **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**  
  - **Cloud SQL Instance**  
  - **External sources** (e.g., APIs, third-party databases)  
- Use **Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow)** for orchestration.  

### **Automated Data Quality Checks:**  
- Implement **Great Expectations** or similar **data validation tools** to check:  
  - Schema consistency  
  - Null/missing values  
  - Data anomalies  
  - Referential integrity  
- Ensure **automated handling of failed quality checks**, including:  
  - Logging failures  
  - Alerting teams  
  - AI-driven fixes (if applicable)  

### **Self-Healing Mechanism:**  
- Use **Generative AI / AI models** to:  
  - **Analyze and correct common data issues** (e.g., missing values, type mismatches, duplicates)  
  - **Automatically retry failed jobs** with optimized parameters  
  - **Detect and predict potential failures** before they occur  
  - **Recommend fixes or autonomously apply them**  

### **Automated Alerting & Monitoring:**  
- Implement **intelligent alerting** to detect pipeline anomalies **before failures happen**, using:  
  - Historical execution trends  
  - AI/ML-based anomaly detection  
- Send alerts via:  
  - **Microsoft Teams notifications**  
  - **Email alerts**  
  - **Cloud Monitoring logs & dashboards**  
- Provide **real-time root cause analysis** and suggested resolutions.  

### **Performance Optimization:**  
- Optimize BigQuery queries to improve **cost efficiency** and **latency**.  
- Implement **partitioning and clustering** strategies.  
- Ensure **pipeline scalability** for handling large datasets.
